		[Verse 1]<br>
		Look at the stars <br>
		Look how they shine for you <br>
		And everything you do <br>
		Yeah, they were all yellow <br>
		I came along <br>
		I wrote a song for you <br>
		And all the things you do <br>
		And it was called "Yellow" <br>
		So then I took my turn <br>
		Oh, what a thing to have done <br>
		And it was all yellow <br>

		[Chorus 1]<br>
		(Aah) Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones <br>
		(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful <br>
		(Aah) You know, you know I love you so <br>
		You know I love you so <br>

		[Verse 2] <br>
		I swam across <br>
		I jumped across for you <br>
		Oh, what a thing to do <br>
		'Cause you were all yellow <br>
		I drew a line <br>
		I drew a line for you <br>
		Oh, what a thing to do <br>
		And it was all yellow <br>
