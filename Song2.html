		Put your head on my shoulder <br>
		Hold me in your arms, baby <br>
		Squeeze me oh so tight <br>
		Show me that you love me too <br>

		[Verse 2] <br>
		Put your lips next to mine, dear <br>
		Won't you kiss me once, baby <br>
		Just a kiss goodnight, maybe <br>
		You and I will fall in love <br>
		(You and I will fall in love) <br>

		[Bridge] <br>
		People say that love's a game <br>
		A game you just can't win <br>
		If there's a way <br>
		I'll find it someday <br>
		And then this fool will rush in <br>

		[Verse 3] <br>
		Put your head on my shoulder <br>
		Whisper in my ear, baby <br>
		Words I want to hear <br>
		Tell me, tell me that you love me too <br>
		(Tell me that you love me too) <br>
