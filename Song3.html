		[Verse 1] <br>
		Why do birds suddenly appear <br>
		Every time you are near? <br>
		Just like me, they long to be <br>
		Close to you <br>
 
		[Verse 2] <br>
		Why do stars fall down from the sky <br>
		Every time you walk by? <br>
		Just like me, they long to be <br>
		Close to you <br>

		[Chorus] <br>
		On the day that you were born <br>
		The angels got together <br>
		And decided to create a dream come true <br>
		So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold <br>
		And starlight in your eyes of blue <br>

		[Verse 3] <br>
		That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town) <br>
		Follow you (Follow you) all around (All around) <br>
		Just like me, they long to be <br>
		Close to you <br>

		[Vocalizing] <br>
		Ah-ah-aaah <br>
		Ah-ah-ah-ah <br>
		Ah-ah-aaah <br>
