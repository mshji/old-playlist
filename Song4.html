		[Verse 1] <br>
		You're just too good to be true <br>
		Can't take my eyes off of you <br>
		You'd be like Heaven to touch <br>
		I wanna hold you so much <br>
		At long last love has arrived <br>
		And I thank God I'm alive <br>
		You're just too good to be true <br>
		Can't take my eyes off you <br>

		[Verse 2] <br>
		Pardon the way that I stare <br>
		There's nothing else to compare <br>
		The sight of you leaves me weak <br>
		There are no words left to speak <br>
		But if you feel like I feel <br>
		Please let me know that it's real <br>
		You're just too good to be true <br>
		Can't take my eyes off you <br>

		[Chorus] <br>
		I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright <br>
		I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night <br>
		I love you, baby, trust in me when I say: <br>
		Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray <br>
		Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay <br>
		And let me love you, baby, let me love you <br>
